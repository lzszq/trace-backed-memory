# Architecture

## Goal

Build a trace-backed, commit-aware, gated memory layer for LLM / agent harness engineering.

The system should answer:

- Has this failure happened before?
- Which commit introduced or fixed it?
- Which prompt version, tool schema, model, or eval suite is involved?
- Is there a verified lesson that applies to the current task?
- Should that memory be injected, summarized, or blocked?

## Layer 1: Trace Store

Trace Store records facts. It should be append-only and auditable.

Recommended fields:

- trace_id
- run_id
- commit_sha
- branch
- prompt_version
- tool_schema_version
- model
- input_hash
- output_hash
- retrieved_context
- tool_calls
- tool_outputs
- eval_result
- latency_ms
- cost_usd
- error
- trace_uri
- created_at

Raw trace is not runtime memory. It is evidence.

## Layer 2: Failure Case Store

Failure cases are structured postmortems derived from failed traces.

Fields:

- case_id
- source_trace_id
- commit_sha
- failure_type
- symptom
- root_cause
- fix
- fix_commit_sha
- status: draft | verified | obsolete
- created_at

Failure cases are episodic memory.

## Layer 3: Lesson Store

Lessons are validated reusable rules derived from verified cases.

Fields:

- lesson_id
- source_case_id
- lesson_text
- memory_type: procedural | semantic | episodic | policy
- scope_json
- confidence
- status: active | obsolete
- created_at

Only active, verified, scoped lessons may be injected into runtime prompts.

## Layer 4: Memory Gate

Memory use requires two gates:

```text
System Gate -> LLM Gate
```

System Gate is deterministic and blocks unsafe or invalid memory.

LLM Gate judges semantic usefulness after System Gate has filtered candidates.

## Non-goals

- Do not build generic personalization memory first.
- Do not inject raw traces directly into prompts.
- Do not treat vector similarity as sufficient proof of relevance.
- Do not allow the LLM to mark memory active without verification.
