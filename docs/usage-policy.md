# Memory Usage Policy

## Rule

Memory is not default context. Memory is historical experience that must be filtered, scoped, and approved before use.

```text
raw trace -> failure case -> verified lesson -> gated runtime memory
```

## Suitable modes

| Mode | Default | Allowed memory | Blocked memory |
|---|---:|---|---|
| debug | use | trace summaries, verified failure cases, fix history | secrets, unrelated raw traces |
| repair | use | verified lessons, previous fixes, tool/prompt policy | draft cases, weak guesses |
| regression | use | commit history, eval history, failure cases | unrelated project memory |
| planning | cautious | project policy, tool policy, procedural lessons | raw traces |
| eval | usually skip | prompt contract, tool schema policy | prior answers, gold labels, evaluator comments |
| production | minimal | active verified scoped lessons | raw trace, draft memory, sensitive memory |

## System Gate

A memory item must satisfy:

```text
status in ["active", "verified"]
scope matches current task
repo / branch / tenant allowed
not obsolete
not sensitive
not eval-leaking
has source_case_id or source_trace_id
```

Reject immediately when:

```text
status = draft
status = obsolete
missing scope
missing source
contains sensitive raw trace
same benchmark expected output
cross-tenant memory
```

## LLM Gate

After System Gate, ask the LLM to judge whether candidate memory should be used.

Recommended prompt:

```text
You are deciding whether retrieved memory should be used for the current LLM/agent task.

Current task:
{{task}}

Current mode:
{{mode}}

Current context:
{{context_summary}}

Candidate memory:
{{candidate_memory}}

Decide whether this memory should be used.

Rules:
1. Use memory only if it is directly relevant to the current task.
2. Do not use memory if it is obsolete, draft, low-confidence, or missing source.
3. Do not use memory if its scope does not match the current repo, tool, prompt family, model family, or eval suite.
4. Do not use memory if it may leak benchmark answers, evaluator reasoning, private user data, secrets, or sensitive tool output.
5. In eval mode, use only project policy, prompt contract, and tool schema policy. Do not use prior answers or failure traces from the same dataset.
6. In debug or repair mode, similar failure cases and verified lessons may be used.
7. In production mode, use only active, verified, scope-matched, short procedural memory.

Return only this JSON:

{
  "use_memory": true,
  "allowed_memory_ids": [],
  "blocked_memory_ids": [],
  "reason": "brief explanation",
  "risk": "none | low | medium | high",
  "recommended_injection": "none | short_summary | full_case_summary | pointer_only"
}
```

## Injection format

Recommended:

```text
Relevant verified memory:

1. [lesson_id: lesson_001]
Scope: planner / search_docs
Rule: When calling search_docs, always provide a non-empty natural-language query.
Source: case_001
```

Forbidden:

```text
raw trace
full prompt history
full user input
tool output with private data
eval expected output
unverified root cause
draft failure case
obsolete lesson
```
